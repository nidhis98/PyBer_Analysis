# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis

  The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the rideshare data for Pyber for the duration of January to early May of 2019. Through the assessed data, the CEO, V. Isualize, should then be able to view the neighborhoods which need improvement. The final analysis also portrays how Pyber is being used across differing city types: urban, suburban, and rural. Using Matplotlib, I was able to make this analysis even more meaningful, as Matplotlib using Python graphing has the ability of turning lines of code into data visualizations. 

Results

  Based on our findings from the Pyber Analysis, a general conclusion which can be drawn is that Pyber’s services have been most used and were most accessible in urban cities. Followed by urban cities, the suburban city type was the next most profitable. However, the total rides completed in urban cities were more than double than that of suburban cities. Lastly, the rural city type fell in the lowest percentile of this analysis. The drivers allocated to this city type were very limited, while the fares set for rides in the rural cities were very high. Recommendations to combat this discrepancy will be provided in the next section.

Summary
Recommendations

1.	Increasing the total number of drivers going to rural areas would substantially boost Pyber’s overall returns, as rural cities are currently the lowest performing city type. As shown in the below summarized data frame, taken from our Matplotlib analysis, it is evident that the number of total drivers available/travelling into rural cities is significantly lower than the other city types. To produce a new number of total drivers for rural cities, a quantitative study should be conducted based on population density, median income, as well as active drivers.

2.	In correspondence with the increase in drivers available in rural cities, the next point of focus should be the average fare per ride in rural areas. The average fare per ride as seen in our analysis, is seemingly higher than in urban areas. This is a notable point, as traffic is lesser in rural areas, therefore meaning that riders should be able to get to their destination quickly and by using the most efficient route. Urban areas are known for heavy traffic during peak hours, construction, and parking/idling car restrictions. This causes a discrepancy between the average fares charged for the two areas which can be further evaluated.

3.	Another area of evaluation is the average fare per driver, which seems to be growing as the number of rides decrease. A general hypothesis which can be made by observing our summarized data is that due to the limitation of drivers in rural cities, the drivers’ fares are increasing. Contrarily, in urban cities, the fares for drivers are significantly lower, while many more rides are being completed. By altering the designations of the total drivers available, we can see a potential growth in the total number of rides completed in rural cities. We should also be able to see a difference in the total fares for drivers based on the rides they are completing.
